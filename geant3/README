 testem3/src is the geant3 equivalent of TestEm3
 
 % cd geant3
 % gmakeB           to make an executable  (Batch version) 
 % gmakeT           to make an executable  (inTeractive version)
 
 To execute:
  
 % cd geant3
 % $G4SYSTEM/testem3.xb (for batch) or testem1.xt (for interactive)
 
 The program will ask:
 G3 > gives the filename of the data cards to be read:
 
 run01.dat      (runNN.dat is the equivalent of the G4 runNN.mac)
 
 It is possible to set the production cuts BCUTE, DCUTE and PPCUTM
 medium by medium, via the data cards:
 CUTPR  imed1  bcute/m   dcute/m  ppcutm
 CUTPR  imed2  bcute/m   dcute/m  ppcutm
 ...etc............
 
 testem3 produces histograms which are saved as testem3.paw : 
  histo 1 : energy deposit in absorber 1 (edep/Ebeam)
  histo 2 : energy deposit in absorber 2 (edep/Ebeam)
  ...etc...........
  
 One can control the binning of the histograms with the data card:
  *HISTO  id1  nbin  vmin  vmax 
  *HISTO  id2  nbin  vmin  vmax
  ...etc...........
  
 It is possible to set the max allowed step size STEMAX,
 via the data card:
 STEPMX  stepmax (in cm)
 (However this value will be taken into account only if auto=0)
