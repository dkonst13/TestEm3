     =========================================================
     Geant4 - an Object-Oriented Toolkit for Simulation in HEP
     =========================================================

                            TestEm3
                            -------

	This example simulates a simple Sampling Calorimeter setup.
	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
 	The calorimeter is a box made of a given number of layers.
	A layer consists of a sequence of various absorbers (maximum 10).
	The layer is replicated.
 	
 	Parameters defining the calorimeter :
 	- the number of layers,
 	- the number of absorbers within a layer,		
 	- the material of the absorbers,
	- the thickness of the absorbers,
 	- the transverse size of the calorimeter (the input face is a square). 
 	
 	In addition a transverse uniform magnetic field can be applied.
 	
 	The default geometry is constructed in DetectorConstruction class,
 	but all of the above parameters can be modified interactively via
 	the commands defined in the DetectorMessenger class.
 	
 	NB. The number of absorbers and the number of layers can be set to 1.
	    In this case we have a unique homogeneous block of matter,
	    which looks like a bubble chamber rather than a calorimeter ...
 	    (see the macro of commands: newgeom.mac)
	    
 2- PHYSICS LISTS

    Physics Lists are subdivided on 4 following modules:
    1. "particles" - particle definitions  
    2. "general" - decays and transportation  
    3. "standard" (alternative) - standard EM physics
    4. "model"    (alternative) - standard EM physics using model approach
    
    Notice that there is an example of definition of a static ion : IonC12
    (see PhysListParticle.cc) and an example of use : ionC12.mac
     	    
 3- AN EVENT : THE PRIMARY GENERATOR
 
 	The primary kinematic consists of a single particle which hits the
 	calorimeter perpendicular to the input face. The type of the particle
 	and its energy are set in the PrimaryGeneratorAction class, and can
 	be changed via the G4 build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see
 	the macros provided with this example).
 	
 	In addition one can choose randomly the impact point of the incident
 	particle. The corresponding interactive command is built in
 	PrimaryGeneratorMessenger class.
 	
 	A RUN is a set of events.
 				
 4- VISUALIZATION
 
 	The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
 	The initialisation of the drawing is done via the commands
 	/vis/... in the macro vis.mac. In interactive session:
	PreInit or Idle > /control/execute vis.mac
 	
 	The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the 
 	calorimeter.
 	
 	The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.
 	Optionaly one can choose to draw all particles, only the charged one,
 	or none. This command is defined in EventActionMessenger class.
 	
 5- PHYSICS DEMO
 
 	The particle's type and the physic processes which will be available
 	in this example are set in PhysicsList class.
 	
 	In addition a build-in interactive command (/process/inactivate proname)
 	allows to activate/inactivate the processes one by one.
 	Then one can well visualize the processes one by one, especially 
 	in the bubble chamber setup with a transverse magnetic field.
 
 	As a homework try to visualize a gamma conversion alone, 
 	or the effect of the multiple scattering.
	
	Notice that one can control the maximum step size at tracking time,
	via G4UserLimit class and the command /tracking/stepMax  
	(see DetectorConstruction and DetectorMessenger classes)
 	
 6- HOW TO START ?
 
 	- compile and link to generate an executable
 		% cd TestEm3
 		% gmake
 		
 	- execute TestEm3 in 'batch' mode from macro files
 		% TestEm3   run01.mac
 		
 	- execute TestEm3 in 'interactive mode' with visualization
 		% TestEm3
 		....
 		Idle> type your commands. For instance:
 		Idle> /control/execute run01.mac
 		....
 		Idle> exit
 	
 7- HISTOGRAMS
 
 Testem3 produces histograms : 
  histo 1 : energy deposit in absorber 0
  histo 2 : energy deposit in absorber 1
  ...etc...........
  
 One can control the binning of the histo with the command:
  /testem/run/setHisto   idAbsor  nbin  Emin  Emax  unit 
  ...etc...........  
  where unit is the desired energy unit for that histo (see TestEm3.in).

 One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
 /testem/run/setFileName  name  (default testem3.paw)
 
 Note that, by default, histograms are disabled. To activate them, uncomment
 the flag USE_AIDA or USE_ROOT (exclusive or) in GNUmakefile.

 8- Using the Anaphe implementation of the AIDA 3.0 histograms:
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 In order to use the Anaphe implementation of the AIDA 3.0 interfaces, 
 the 'aida-config' command (which is used in the GNUmakefile) is 
 available at:
 /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/latest/scripts/aida-config 

 In order to run the executable, you need to source the following
 script (once):
 $HOME/bin/setupAnaphe.csh  (or $HOME/bin/setupAnaphe)

 At cern 'setupAnaphe' is available at: 
 /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/latest/scripts/setupAnaphe.csh
 (or /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/share/LHCXX/latest/scripts/setupAnaphe)
 
 9- ROOT
 
 To install root, see http://root.cern.ch
 Make sure that the environment variable ROOTSYS, used in GNUmakefile, is
 defined:
 
 setenv ROOTSYS /???/ROOT/root_v3_10_02
 setenv PATH ${PATH}:${ROOTSYS}/bin
 setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${ROOTSYS}/lib:/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.95.3:.
